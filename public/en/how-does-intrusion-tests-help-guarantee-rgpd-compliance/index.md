# How penetration tests help ensure GDPR compliance?


# Penetration testing and GDPR compliance: the essentials

## A matter of protection

As a business leader, it is unlikely that you have never heard the term **GDPR**. Indeed, it has been at the heart of digital concerns for businesses for several years 🛡️.

**The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** imposes strict standards regarding the **protection of personal data** within the European Union.

Since its implementation in **May 2018**, companies have had to take rigorous measures to secure the data **they collect and process**. Among these measures, penetration testing proves to be an **essential tool for ensuring GDPR compliance**.

But in what way? 🤔

The main risk is obviously the **financial penalties** that can go up to **20 million euros**. But don’t panic! Just below, I’ll give you the best tips to help you avoid these inconveniences. 😉

## What is a penetration test?

Before going any further, it is interesting to concretely define the term **penetration test**.

A **penetration test**, also colloquially called **"pentest"**, is a **simulation of an attack on an IT system** carried out by security experts (like Trackflaw, for example 👤).

The goal is to **identify vulnerabilities** that could be exploited by cybercriminals to access, in particular, sensitive data (sensitive data, GDPR, that should ring a bell 💡).

Penetration tests can be conducted on different aspects of an infrastructure, such as **internal systems**, **web applications**, or even **mobile devices**.

## GDPR compliance and penetration testing: an unavoidable alliance

But why is penetration testing **crucial** for GDPR compliance? 🤔 

Well, for several reasons.

The first is that **GDPR** requires companies to **ensure the confidentiality and security of personal data**.
According to **Article 32 of the regulation**, companies must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to **ensure a level of security** appropriate to the risk.
This includes, among other things, measures to **protect data** against **destruction**, **loss**, **alteration**, **disclosure**, or **unauthorized access**.

And this is where penetration testing comes in. 🕵️

By identifying **security flaws** before they are exploited, penetration tests allow companies to **take proactive corrective measures**. This not only helps to **strengthen overall security** but also demonstrates that **the company takes its obligations seriously** regarding data protection, a crucial aspect in the event of an audit or compliance check by the authorities.

But there’s also a second, very different reason proving that penetration testing is indispensable...

## Fines and non-compliance

![Fines](/images/comment-les-tests-dintrusion-aident-à-garantir-la-conformité-rgpd-/3.png)

Indeed, companies do not make efforts just to please the government. Implementing GDPR policies is expensive, and many companies would gladly avoid it 😂

So, the government has an infallible technique to motivate compliance: **fines** 💰

But then, how can a penetration test help you **avoid GDPR-related fines**?

It is worth noting that fines for non-compliance with GDPR can be **very severe**, up to **20 million euros** or **4% of annual global turnover**, whichever is higher. One of the **main causes** of these fines is the **lack of adequate security measures** to protect personal data.

A **regular penetration test** ensures that the security measures in place are **effective** and **compliant** with **GDPR requirements**.

In the event of a data breach, being able to demonstrate that the company has **conducted penetration tests** and **addressed** identified vulnerabilities can work in its favor. This can not only **reduce the impact** of a potential fine but also preserve the company’s reputation.

## Steps to successful GDPR compliance

But how do you successfully achieve GDPR compliance?

It is crucial to follow several steps. The goal is not to create a complete guide, only the main points will be covered 📔

### 1. Assessing needs

The first step is **assessing your needs**.

The goal is to **identify the systems and applications** processing personal data that require a penetration test.

Some examples that we often find with our clients:

- Office365 cloud infrastructure.
- E-commerce web application.
- Internal information system.
- Accounting application accessible from the internet.
- Etc.

### 2. Choose a qualified provider

The second step is choosing a **qualified and experienced provider**. And it just so happens that we have someone to recommend! 😃

Another article is also available on our blog to help you [choose your penetration test provider](/choisir-son-prestataire-de-test-intrusion/).

In summary, it is important to select a penetration test provider with **solid experience and references** in the field of IT security and GDPR compliance. Don’t hesitate to contact us to clarify any needs. 📨

### 3. Properly plan and execute tests

A crucial step in the process: **planning** and **executing** the penetration tests.

Clearly define the test objectives. Ask yourself the following questions.

- What needs to be tested?
- Are there sensitive applications to prioritize?
- Should accounts or documentation be provided?

Ensure that the test covers both **technical vulnerabilities** and human flaws. It is therefore very interesting to subscribe to a **pedagogical phishing campaign** to assess your employees' resilience to cybersecurity threats.

### 4. Understand and correct weaknesses

Surely one of the most challenging steps: **analyzing results** and **correcting** identified flaws.

After the test, carefully analyze the results. **Fix the identified flaws** and **conduct a new test (re-audit)** if necessary to ensure that the corrections have been effective.

This step is far from trivial, and we can **support you from start to finish** to help you make the most of the audit conducted.

### 5. Capitalize

Finally, to conclude, the last step is to capitalize on this audit.

Keep detailed documentation of the **tests conducted**, the **identified vulnerabilities**, and the **corrective measures taken**. This documentation will be valuable in the event of an audit or security incident.

## Conclusion

So? Is GDPR clearer to you now? 😄

In conclusion, penetration testing is **much more than just a technical check**; it is a key element of the GDPR compliance strategy.

By identifying and correcting vulnerabilities before they are exploited, penetration tests allow companies to **demonstrate their commitment to protecting personal data**. This not only helps to **avoid potentially devastating fines** but also **strengthens customer** and **partner trust** in the company’s ability to secure sensitive information.

Regularly integrating penetration tests into your security strategy is therefore essential to remain GDPR compliant and to protect your business against the growing threats in cyberspace.
