# 💉 Reverse tab nabbing, phishing on steroids.

## Are you familiar with reverse tab nabbing?

🐟 Reverse tab nabbing is a phishing attack technique that involves redirecting a tab's original page to a malicious one. This technique is particularly vicious as it can trick users into thinking they're still on the legitimate site they originally visited.

## An example

To help you understand this attack, here's a realistic scenario.

1️⃣ &nbsp;A victim browses a vulnerable site and clicks on a teaser link pointing to https://legit-store.com

2️⃣ &nbsp;The legit-store.com website offers a great discount on their products.

3️⃣ &nbsp;While the user is busy, legit-store.com redirects the user's social network tab to an identical phishing site.

4️⃣ &nbsp;The user closes the legit-store.com site (not that interesting the discounts).

5️⃣ &nbsp;He returns to his social networking tab... containing the fake phishing site.

6️⃣ &nbsp;The unsuspecting user "reconnects" to the fake site. 😭
