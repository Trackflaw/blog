# CVE-2023-23397 - The Outlook meeting that exfiltrates your password.


Outlook suffers from a lack of control over the user input that allows to configure the sound of a meeting and appointment reminder. Indeed, an attacker is able to force a victim to make a connection to its server without any manipulation from the user (zero click vulnerability).

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability retrieves a NetNTLMv2 digest based on the password of the trapped user through an SMB request. The request is triggered as soon as the mail arrives in the inbox.
