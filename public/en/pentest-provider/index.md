### 1. Rigorous methodologies

To guarantee exhaustive testing, Trackflaw **meticulously follows the OWASP** methodology, divided into 12 sections.

Each of these sections includes sample tests to verify an application's functionality and best assess its overall level of security. A similar methodology is applied to internal and mobile penetration testing.

### 2. No scanner report

Automatic vulnerability scanners are powerful and useful tools in our business.

However, some unscrupulous companies offer this type of tool as a real penetration testing service, degrading our image as auditors.

These tools **cannot guarantee the completeness of the tests** carried out, and therefore distort the overall assessment of the security level of the audited perimeter.

### 3. An exhaustive report

An auditor's job is first and foremost to clearly and concisely communicate the various weaknesses identified to the audited teams, so as to provide them with the greatest possible assistance in their corrective work.

Audit reports are thus **the most important elements**. Trackflaw devotes a great deal of attention to them, so that they can be fully assimilated by both **managerial and highly technical audiences**.

The various sections are designed to be understood by all levels of a company's hierarchy.

### 4. No subcontracting

Many unscrupulous companies subcontract their penetration tests for a variety of reasons.

This lack of professionalism leads to problems of confidentiality, follow-up and transparency for the client. At Trackflaw, in order to guarantee the firm's know-how, high standards and brand image, as well as to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the elements handled during audits, no mission is subcontracted.

**Only the company's own staff are authorized to take part in audits**.

### 5. Attractive rates
