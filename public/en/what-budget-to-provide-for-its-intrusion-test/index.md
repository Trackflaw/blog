# What budget to provide for its intrusion test


# ðŸ’° How much does a computer intrusion test cost in 2024?

## Cybersecurity: a 21st-century issue

In an ever-evolving digital world, **computer intrusion tests** are becoming increasingly crucial for ensuring the security of a company's information systems. ðŸŽ¯

Whether it's to protect sensitive data or to maintain business operations, **cybersecurity** is at the heart of every organization's concerns.

One of the most frequent questions that companies ask is the **cost of a penetration test in 2024**. This article is here to guide you through the various factors influencing the cost of a penetration test and how to effectively budget for this essential operation.

## What is an intrusion test?

But what exactly is an intrusion test? And what is it used for? ðŸ¤”

It can be summarized quite **simply**!

An **intrusion test**, also incorrectly called a **penetration test** in common language, is a proactive method for assessing the security of a computer system or network by **simulating a realistic digital attacker attack**.

At Trackflaw, we are experts in this field, and like our colleagues, we use various techniques to identify and exploit existing vulnerabilities.
This allows for simulating real scenarios of compromising systems, servers, or web applications.

The methods used may include **black box**, **gray box**, or **white box** approaches, each offering a different perspective on system security.

But what is the difference between a **black box**, **gray box**, and **white box** approach? ðŸ¤”

Well, great question! Two other articles on this topic are also available on our blog:

## Factors influencing the cost of a penetration test

Before we can truly answer the question, it is necessary to list the different criteria for correctly pricing a penetration test service.

### Asking the right questions

![Asking the right questions](/images/quel-budget-prÃ©voir-pour-son-test-intrusion/2.png)

Start by asking yourself these **3 important questions**:

1. Why do I need a penetration test?
2. Do I have the resources and means internally (or not) to apply the audit's recommendations?
3. In the long term, what are my cybersecurity goals?

{{< admonition type=question title="Ask us your questions!" open=true >}}
There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. But maybe you can't answer one or more of these questions precisely? ðŸ¤”

### Criteria to consider

You have answers to the three questions above! Perfect, let's continue! Otherwise, feel free to make an appointment with us to discuss it! ðŸ“ž

Below is a list (not exhaustive) of criteria to consider. These are the most common:

1. **Scope of the test**
    - The scope of the test is one of the **main** factors influencing the cost.
    - The more **vast and complex** the system to be tested, the **more expensive the test will be**. For example, testing a small institutional website in **black box** will not cost as much as performing a penetration test on a **complex internal network** containing numerous servers and machines.

2. **Type of test**
    - The cost will also vary depending on the type of penetration test chosen: **black box**, **gray box**, or **white box**.
    - Black box tests are often **less expensive** because they require less access to internal systems or the web application, while **white box** tests require full access and are therefore **more costly to perform**.

3. **Complexity of the IT systems**
    - Systems using **advanced** or obsolete technologies may require specialized skills increasing the cost of the test (for example: industrial systems).
    - Moreover, **custom** or unusual configurations often require additional efforts to perform an effective test. But don't worry, the impact is often quite manageable on the price ðŸ˜Š

4. **Experience and qualifications of the auditors**
    - The expertise and qualifications of the security consultants performing the tests can also affect the cost.
    - An **experienced and certified** auditor will necessarily be **more demanding in terms of salary** than a junior auditor. Certifications such as **OSCP**, eWPT, or those issued by ANSSI (**PASSI**) can indicate a higher level of competence, which can influence the daily rate of the provider.


## The question of budget

Now coming to the answer to the question you all are waiting for: `How much does a penetration test cost?` ðŸ˜‚

![How much does a penetration test cost?](/images/quel-budget-prÃ©voir-pour-son-test-intrusion/3.png)

And once again, it's not that simple!

As seen above, the cost of a penetration test can **vary widely depending on different factors**.

In 2024, for small businesses, the cost can start at **a few thousand euros** for basic tests. For medium and large businesses, the cost can rise to **several tens of thousands of euros**, especially if they require more complex tests or regular tests for various applications and systems.

### Generic table

Below, a table to quickly find your way around ðŸ‘‡

| **Type of test**           | **Estimated cost**     | **Estimated time**    | **Suitable scope**                               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Flash penetration test     | Less than 4,000â‚¬       | Less than 2 days      | External                                         |
| Black box penetration test | From 4,000â‚¬ to 7,000â‚¬  | Between 2 and 6 days  | External, mobile                                 |
| Gray box penetration test  | From 5,000â‚¬ to 12,000â‚¬ | Between 3 and 10 days | External, internal, mobile                       |
| White box penetration test | From 6,000â‚¬ to 15,000â‚¬ | Between 5 and 12 days | External, internal, mobile, complex applications |

### Efficiently budgeting

Finally, to finish and budget efficiently, consider the following elements:

- **Clearly define your security goals**: understanding what you want to test and why can help you determine the most appropriate type of test and evaluate offers from providers.
- **Evaluate multiple providers**: obtain quotes from several providers to compare costs and services offered.
- **Plan regular tests**: cybersecurity is an ongoing process. Planning regular tests can often reduce long-term costs through preferential rates for regular clients.

## Conclusion

The cost of a computer intrusion test in 2024 **will depend on many factors**, including the complexity of your IT environment, the type of test chosen, and the expertise required to perform it.

By understanding these factors and planning appropriately, you can **ensure the protection of your systems against cyberattacks while respecting your budget**.

Investing in a penetration test is a **wise choice** to protect your company's essential digital assets against the growing threats in cyberspace.
